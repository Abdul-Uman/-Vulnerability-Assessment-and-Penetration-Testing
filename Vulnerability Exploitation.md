## Stage 5: Vulnerability Exploitation(Penetration Testing)

• Penetration Testing is the next step to Vulnerability Assessment aiming 
   to penetrate the target system based on exploits available for the 
   identified vulnerabilities. For exploitation, our own knowledge or 
   publicaly available exploits of well-known vulnerabilities can be 
   utilized.  

• Once any vulnerability is exploited to gain access to the system, the 
   attacker should aim to further detail the network by sniffing traffic, 
   mapping the internal network, and trying to obtain a higher privilege 
   account to gain the maximum level of access to the system.

### Priority based on 

**Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Score**,

 Where,

**CVSS Score = 0 -> Info Criticality**

**CVSS Score = <4-> Low Criticality**

**CVSS Score = <7-> Medium Critcality**

**CVSS Score = <10-> High Criticality**

**CVSS Score = 10 -> Critical Criticality**
	

In this stage, you will attempt to exploit identified vulnerabilities to assess their impact:

**1. Prioritize vulnerabilities based on severity and which are Exploitable.**
