## Stage 1: Scoping

Scoping is the initial phase where the boundaries and objectives of the VAPT are defined. This includes:

1. Identifying the **Target systems**.
2. Defining the goals and limitations of the test.
3. Determining the testing methodologies (Blackbox vs. Greybox).

    • In **Black box testing**, only details such as the IP address are shared with the tester. 
      Details giving an insight to the infrastructure, such as type and OS version, are not 
      shared with respect to Nessus Scanner; this type of testing will involve a non 
      credential scan .This allows the tester to  mimic an external attacker with 
      limited knowledge about the infrastructure.
  
    • In **Grey box testing**, will include some details of the infrastructure to be shared, 
      such as the type of device and software version that allow getting more 
      comprehensive and administrator credentials fed to the tool for more 
      comprehensive results. In addition, to mimic an internal attacker with knowledge 
      about the infrastructure with respect to Nessus Scanner, this type of testing will 
      involve credentialed scanning, giving more comprehensive results.  

4. In this project i will do both **Blackbox testing as well as Grey Box Testing**
