## Stage 4: False Positive Analysis

• As an output of the scanning phase, one would obtain a list of vulnerabilities of 
  the target infrastructure. One of the key activities to be performed with the 
  output would be false positive analysis, that is, removing any vulnerability that 
  is falsely reported by the tool and does not exist in reality. 

• All scanning tools are prone to report false positives, and this analysis can be 
  done using methods such as correlating vulnerabilities with each other and 
  previously gathered information and scan reports, along with actually checking 
  whether system access is available. 

• Vulnerability scanners give their own risk rating to the identified 
  vulnerabilities; these can be revisited considering the actual criticality of the 
  infrastructure element (server or network device) to the network and impact of 
  the vulnerability.
