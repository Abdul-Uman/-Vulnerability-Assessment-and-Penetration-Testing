## Introduction

"This repository provides a comprehensive guide to performing Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) using Nessus. The lab is divided into six 
 stages: Scoping, Information Gathering, Vulnerability Scanning, False Positive Analysis, Vulnerability Exploitation, and Report Generation with detailed steps and 
 examples to help you effectively assess and secure your target systems."

## Installation

Before starting the VAPT process, it's crucial to install and configure Nessus. Follow the instructions to download, install, and activate Nessus, ensuring it's ready for scanning.

## Stage 2: Information Gathering

In this stage, you'll gather critical information about the target, such as open ports, OS versions, and running services using tools like Nmap.
